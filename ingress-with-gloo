# Gloo as Kubernetes Ingress

Gloo is an Edge Gateway and Kubernetes Ingress Controller built on Envoy Proxy.

These directions assume you have a prepared Kubernetes cluster. Full details on setting up your
Kubernetes cluster [here](../cluster_setup).

## Install Gloo on Kubernetes with `glooctl`

On a running Kubernetes cluster, run the following command to deploy the Gloo Ingress Controller to the `gloo-system` namespace:

```bash
glooctl install ingress
```

> Note: You can run the command with the flag `--dry-run` to output
the Kubernetes manifests (as `yaml`) that `glooctl` will
apply to the cluster instead of installing them.

Additional Gloo install options [here](https://gloo.solo.io/installation/ingress/)

## Configuration
Kubernetes Ingress Controllers are for simple traffic routing in a Kubernetes cluster. Gloo supports managing Ingress objects with the glooctl install ingress command, Gloo will configure Envoy using Kubernetes Ingress objects created by users.

* Basic ingress object managed by Gloo
* TLS dconfiguration
